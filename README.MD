# Calculator Application

A simple Java-based console application that performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculation. The application provides an interactive interface for users to input numbers and select operations.


## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Advanced Operations**: Exponentiation and Square Root calculation.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Handles invalid numeric input gracefully.
  - Prevents division by zero.
  - Handles square root of negative numbers.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: User-friendly prompts for inputs and operation selection.


## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **Scanner Class**: For user input handling.
- **Math Library**: For advanced mathematical computations.


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd calculator-app
   ```
3. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```


## Usage

1. Run the application, and you will be prompted to choose an operation:
   ```
   Select an operation:
   1. Add
   2. Subtract
   3. Multiply
   4. Divide
   5. Power
   6. Square Root
   7. Exit
   Enter your choice:

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter numbers and view the result of the chosen operation.

3. To exit, select option `7`.


## Example

**Input**:
Select an operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Power
6. Square Root
7. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

**Output**:
Result: 15.0


## Future Improvements

- Add support for trigonometric functions.
- Provide a GUI for improved user experience.
- Implement history tracking for operations.
